# How It's Made:

Front End
Tech used: React and CSS

Back End
Tech used: Node.js, Express, MongoDB

Tippin_Waitlist was built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack. The goal was to create a platform where businesses could manage demand efficiently, improve their business offerings and customer service, and improve their company's online reputation.

On the back-end, I set up a Node.js server using Express.js for API routes. The data was stored in a MongoDB database where i utilized Mongoose for access and manipulation of the data. For security measures I implemented JWT authentication, password hashing, data validation, email validation, and email confirmation.

The front-end was developed using React and Axios, with a focus on creating an smooth and simple user experience. The interface lets owners manage their waitlist and reviews. Using the interface, customers could add themselves to the waitlist and leave anonymous reviews. The responsive design made the application accessible on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices.

The application was deployed on cloud platforms, using a combination of Firebase and Cyclic.

# Optimizations
 1. Asset optimization: To reduce application load times and improve overall performance, I optimized the size and format of images.

# Lessons Learned:
Developing Tippin_Waitlist taught me several lessons that have helped me grow as a Software Engineer:

1. Security: Secure Database by allowing only trusted network IP's, secure your server with TLS to encrypt data sent between applications and web server.
2. Single-thread optimization: Optimize your resources and code to improve application and user experience.
3. Continues Development: Automate your delivery process to shorten Software Development lifecycle.
